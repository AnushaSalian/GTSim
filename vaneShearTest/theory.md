### INTRODUCTION<br>

<p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;">One of the major strength parameters studied for the soil is its shear strength. It symbolizes the amount of shear stress i.e., the load that the soil can withstand at any given time with respect to different environmental conditions.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;">Thus shear strength of soil may be explained as the maximum shear stress that the soil can withstand without undergoing any structural damage or any failure.</p>

<p>The drainage path of the water plays an important role in the shear tests performed.</p>

<p>The various drainage paths employed while performing the tests are:</p>

<li> Drained :</li>
<p>In this method the water is allowed to pass through both the sides of the soil sample. In field conditions this happens when the soil has been sandwiched between two sand or any other highly permeable layers.</p>

<li> Partially drained :</li>
<p>In this type of drainage path, water is allowed to pass only through one side of the soil sample. In field conditions this happens when the soil is sandwiched between one hard rock layer and a permeable layer.</p>

<li> Undrained  :</li>
<p>Here the water is not allowed to pass through the soil sample. In field conditions this situation occurs when the soil is sandwiched between two hard rock layers.</p>

#### Shear strength tests

<p>The different types of tests employed to quantify the shear strength of soil are:</p>
<li> Direct shear test or shear box test</li>
<li> Triaxial compression test</li>
<li> Unconfined compression test</li>
<li> Vane shear test</li>
<li> Borehole shear test</li></br>

<p>Direct shear test, triaxial compression test and unconfined compression tests are purely lab tests that are performed on the collected soil sample whereas vane shear test and borehole shear test can be performed at the site and Vane shear test is the most commonly used test method to find out the unconfined shear strength of the soil at its natural undisturbed state.</p>

#### Scope and Need

<li> By conducting this test on the soil sample, we can find out the shear strength of the soil in its original state or even in the remoulded state.</li>
<li> Thus this test can be carried out on undisturbed as well as disturbed samples.</li>
<li> This test can be used to find out the sensitivity of soft clays.</li></br>

<p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;">The discharge over notch is measured by measuring the head acting over the notch. As water approaches t
he notch, its surface becomes curved. Therefore, the head over the notch is to be measured at the upstream of the notch where the effect of curvature is minimum. Also, it should be close to the notch so that the loss of energy between head measuring section and notch is negligible. In practical, the head over notch is measured at a distance of 3 to 4 times the maximum head from the notch.</p>

#### V-notch or Triangular notch

<p>The V-notch or triangular notch is sharp crested notch, which is maily used to determine the low rate of flow.</p>

<p>Let,</p>
<p>H = Height of the liquid above the apex of the notch,</p>
<p>&theta; = Angle of the notch,</p>
<p>C<sub>d</sub> = Coefficient of discharge,</p>
<p>From the geometry of the figure, we find that,</p>

<p>The total discharge over the whole notch may be found out only by integrating the above equation within the limits 0 and H.</p>
